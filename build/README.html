<h6 id="src">src</h6>

<pre><code>contains all of the java files from when I was testing out possible methods of webscaping. The only one I use currently is the TakeInSearchedInfo.java file which is the one that actually uses jsoup to webscrape and take in/write the data to the JSON file.

<pre><code>Contains the jsoup library

<h3 id="src:">src:</h3>

<pre><code>All of the same methods as the Build folder (I would remove this but last time I did I spent an hour fixing all the damage it caused)

<pre><code>config folder for codekit and the server its running 
</code></pre>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the actual code from Github</li>
<li>Download the jsoup library by:

<ol>
<li>Opening IntelliJ (Jsoup is compatible with other IDE’s but this is the one I used)</li>
<li>Click file → project structure → libraries → the + button → From Maven button</li>
<li>In the search bar, type org.jsoup:jsoup:1.12.1</li>
<li>Check the download to Users/… checkbox, apply changes and hit ok</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In order for some of the code to work it needs to be run on a server, therefore you have to run a local server of some kind. To download the one I’m using:

<ol>
<li>Go to https://codekitapp.com/ and click “download the app”</li>
<li>Add the 20timeproject to projects in codekit</li>
<li>Go to settings → project settings → building process</li>
<li>Check the “This project uses a build folder” button</li>
<li>Set the Build folder name to build and the source Folder name to src</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Remaining bugs/ unimplemented features:</p>

<p>First and foremost, the formatting of the items on the website needs to be fixed up so that it is in rows of 3 items, the size of the pictures lines up with the adjacent box, and so that it looks more like the original template in general (I’m not sure what I did to mess it up.) Next, I will need to make it so my Java code also takes in the items URL address, which shouldn’t be too hard. Then I need to finish making it so the search box and whatever is inputted to it will be added to the interest list. Finally, I need to connect the interests section to the java code and have it run alongside the website; I will most likely do this through the use of an applet.
I would also like to add to the products.html section but this was a lower priority.</p>
